# 3D-Printing
I have attached here a few 3D printing projects, which I have made. These 3D models have been made on the Autodesk Fusion 360 Software. I have attached the .stl files of the models designed by me.
In the objects, I have added simple designs in a creative format so that at the time of printing, the 3D Printer doesn't take much time to print it and after getting printed, the models look  nice and creative. With some designs, I have even added animation, so that even before printing, the object can be seen through all angles.
